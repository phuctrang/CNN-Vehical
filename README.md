# CNN-Vehical
I using Convolution neural network for classify vehical
## Idea: 
1. I tried rawling data on google image with "Keywords" (My key are: bus, car and motobike), my project is three classes
2. The my size data after crawling is small dataset, i used augmentation data for than more diversity to Icrease my Acc model

## What i get
1. I trained model on Regular Data achieved 86% for data test / else with Augmentation data, I evalution with 33% Acc
2. From that, I conclude that augmentation data does not always improve the accuracy of the model

Tks for reading!
